Although trading in the shares of the VOC began in 1609 on the Amsterdam exchange, an upstart rival, the Imperial India company of Antwerp publically offered their shares in 1723, and quickly sold out to eager investors seeking to participate in Asian trade. The capital raised by the Imperial India Company financed extraordinarily profitable voyages to China where the firm's merchants traded for casks of Chinese tea, fine silks and other exotica.

One particularly fascinating example of this was The New Russia Company. In April of 1868 Hughes signed an agreement with the Russian Prince Serge Kochubei to form the New Russia Company for the \"exploitation of mineral deposits\" in the Donbass region of the Ukraine. A skillful manager, Hughes turned his knowledge of mining and manufacturing into a virtual monopoly within Russia.

A large town grew up among the shadows of the factory, known first as Hughesovka. With Hughes death in 1889, the company was left to the direction of his four surviving sons. By 1895 the Company had doubled its original registered capital and by the end of the 19th century, the New Russia Company was the largest iron producer in the Russian Empire. Following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, almost all of the Company's foreign employees left the country and the factories were taken over in 1919. Hughesovka was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, but remained the largest city in the Donbass and one of the largest metallurgical centers in the country. Investor hopes spring eternal. British investors finally dissolved The New Russia Company almost one hundred years after its revolutionary conception in1970. The success of Hughes enterprise is a testament to his contribution to the spread of industrialization throughout the world. As Russia seeks foreign development capital and joint-ventures, it is well to remember the pioneering success of John Hughes and the legacy of Hughesovka.

In December of 1792, a petition was submitted for this important bridge to be built and in 1793 the NH legislatures granted petitioners the exclusive right of building this toll bridge over the Piscataqua River.

The company was founded with British and Belgian capital and was based in Belgium. By 1898 there was no longer any British shareholders and the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company changed its name to the Abir Congo Company and changed its residence for tax purposes to the Free State. The company was granted a large concession in the north of the country and the rights to tax the inhabitants. This tax was taken in the form of rubber obtained from a relatively rare rubber vine. The collection system revolved around a series of trade posts along the two main rivers in the concession. Each post was commanded by a European agent and manned with armed sentries to enforce taxation and punish any rebels.\u000b \u000bAbir enjoyed a boom through the late 1890s, by selling a kilogram of rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr which had cost them just 1.35 fr to collect and transport. However, this came at a cost to the human rights of those who couldn't pay the tax with imprisonment, flogging and other corporal punishment recorded. Abir's failure to suppress destructive harvesting methods and to maintain rubber plantations meant that the vines became increasingly scarce and by 1904 profits began to fall. During the early 1900s famine and disease spread across the concession, a natural disaster judged by some to have been exacerbated by Abir's operations, further hindering rubber collection. The 1900s also saw widespread rebellions against Abir's rule in the concession and attempts at mass migration to the French Congo or southwards. These events typically resulted in Abir dispatching an armed force to restore order.\u000b \u000bA series of reports into the operation of the Free State were issued starting with the British Consul, Roger Casement's Casement Report and followed by reports commissioned by the Free State and Leopold II. These detailed unlawful killings and other abuses made by Abir and Leopold II was embarrassed into instituting reforms. These began with the appointment of American Richard Mohun by Leopold II as director of Abir. However, rubber exports continued to fall and rebellions increased, resulting in the Free State assuming control of the concession in 1906. Abir continued to receive a portion of profits from rubber exports and in 1911 was refounded as a rubber plantation harvesting company. The later history of the company is unknown but it was still active in 1926.","location":"Congo, Democratic Republic of the","date":null,"period":"20th Century","type":"security, debt","gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":1295,"title":"Bond issued by U.S. Treasury, signed by Clement Biddle, 1790, United States of America","description":"Bond issued by U.S. Treasury, signed by Clement Biddle, 1790, United States of America\u000bClement Biddle was an American Revolutionary soldier born in Philadelphia.

The company used its foundation capital to buy state debt, and in return, it received numerous privileges for trade with South America. Until then Spain had been the supreme power there. However, in its first two years, the South Sea Company's income was only six percent interest from the state. In 1713, the company acquired the right to the 'Asiento', Which had been granted by France to Britain in the Peace of Utrecht. Under this agreement the South Sea Company was allowed to deliver 4800  slaves yearly to the Spanish colonies. Thereafter, the company and the price of its shares slowly gathered momentum. Before, the share price had languished for a long time at 75 to 80 percent of the issue price. The price did not start to boom until the start of 1720, when it became known that the South Sea Company would accept further state debts in payment for its shares. At the same time, it reserved the right to increase its capital as often as it pleased. Furthermore, it was free to choose the issue price. In the following months, the stock price boomed to more then 300 percent. Other very successful share issues followed. At the beginning of July 1720, the stock climbed to percent 800th In the same month, a mega-emission of five million at the phenomenal price of 1.000 percent was carried out. At the time, the London Journal wrote: \"The Turmoil Of Our wave makers at the stock market was so big, that it exceeded all of the until now known dimensions. There was just a running from one coffeehouse to another, from one tavern to the next, to draw shares and to sign them without verifying the brochures. The general call out what 'For God's sake, let's draw and sign, it does not matter what!' \"In the Shade of the South Sea Company, many more companies were promoted and a few were established. In his book \"The history of economic crises,\" published in 1874, Max Wirth identified 202 such \"bubble companies\". Back to the South Sea Company: In July 1720, with the price at 1.100 percent, the party was over. The first sellers trampled on the plan. Already one month after it had reached its peak, the share price lost a third of its value. Two months later, it stood at one tenth of its record high. Speculators who had borrowed to buy the shares were buried under their debts, various banks held back their payments and the Bank of England got itself into trouble. It was the first time - and as the Nasdaq has verified again, not the last time in history - that a large part of the public lost everything in a speculative rush. But the South Sea Company was too big to be allowed to fail. Thanks to major recapitalization by the government measures the company survived the speculation bubble and continued until 1853, although in its last years it did not trade and its main function was to service debt government.","location":"United Kingdom","date":null,"period":"18th Century or before","type":"security","gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":1359,"title":"Talley Bond 1696","description":"May 11, 1696 4% Tally Bond of \u00c2\u00a3100 pay to Richard, Earle of Ranelagh\u000bEdward Russell 1st, Earl of Orford (First Lord of the Admiralty) had from 1694 to 1699, the last post of Admiral of England held (also Lord Admiral and later Lord High Admiral).

Accion de 500 escudos. black. #2000. No 2530. The 'Caracas Company', the Real Compania Guipuzcoana de Caracas, was formed by a group of merchants in the Guipuzcoa province, around San Sebastian, in the Basque region of Spain, to trade with the Caracas province of Venezuela, with the further aims of (a) developing its agriculture, especially cocoa, and (b) keeping watch on the coast, from the mouth of the river Orinoco to the river Hacha (later extended to cover Maracaibo). This latter aim was to prevent illegal (in Spanish eyes) trading, particularly by the Dutch from Cura\u00c3\u00a7ao. The leader of this group was the Count of Penaflorida. This was the first of the great Spanish overseas trading companies, and the first Spanish trading company known to have issued shares to the general public. The company had the right to send two ships per year from San Sebastian and nearby Pasajes to Venezuela, carrying all types of Spanish goods. For the return voyage the ships brought precious metals, cocoa, sugar, tobacco and leathers, back to Sevilla and, later, Cadiz. In 1730 the company set about establishing a chain of trading-posts along the coast of what is now Venezuela and the offshore islands of Margarita and Trinidad, and in 1732 obtained a monopoly of trade between Caracas and Spain; in 1742 this was extended for an indefinite period. In that same year the company's Head Office was moved from San Sebastian to Madrid. From the outset the company was very profitable, paying large dividends to its shareholders. King Felipe V and the Queen took 100 shares each, for a combined investment of 100,000 escudos. The initial capital was 1,000,000 escudos (2,000 shares of 500 escudos of 15 reales each), but shares were a new idea to the Spanish public, and they did not sell well at first; only 500,000 escudos were sold (including those to the royal house, as above). The capital was later increased, in 1752, and again in 1766. The company's activities expanded rapidly, especially after 1734, when restrictions on the number of sailings were removed. The Caracas production, especially of cocoa, rose sharply. By mid-century the company owned 12 large ocean-going ships and 19 coastal ships, with some 2,500 crew, and carrying 2,500 or more tons of freight annually in each direction. However, the company mis-used its monopoly powers, by charging excessive prices for imported goods, and cutting steadily the already low prices paid to Caracas growers for their produce; this, together with interference in the government of Caracas, led in the end to a rebellion by the the colonists. Not until 1752 was this finally subdued, and these events led the Spanish government to reduce the company's privileges and introduce fixed prices for buying cocoa and other produce. Profits fell sharply, and the company's fortunes went into steady decline. Its investments in Spain were unsuccessful; wars against England in 1761-3 and 1779-83 cost it dearly; the free-trading policies of King Carlos III were the final blow. In 1781 the company lost the monopoly with Venezuela, and in 1785 it was absorbed by the Real Compania de Filipinas. The Caracas shares were exchanged for those of the Filipinas company. The share is very attractive, printed on vellum, with a fine copper-engraving. At the top are the royal arms of Guipuzcoa; on each side, and down the sides is a fine design of leaves, fruit,weapons, and an Indian man, with bow-and-arrow, and woman. Boxes of company freight are all around. There is a fine paper seal, also with the royal arms of Guipuzcoa.

After the Swedish acquisition in 1784 of Saint Barth\u00c3\u00a9lemy in the West Indies, town secretary Johan Liljencrants put a proposition to the Chamber of Commerce for the formation of a share-based company to conduct trade in the West Indies.

In guarantee, he offered the Silesia tribute fund, into which payments were made by the princes and nobles of Silesia (thus, the Silesian loan). As interest rates declined, a conversion operation was carried out in 1736. The new bonds, paying 5% interest, were for a total of 700.000 gulden. The new loan was very successful, and within two months had attracted all the capital needed. At first, interest was paid regularly from the contributions by the Silesian nobility. However, after 1742, things changed, when, after the war between Maria Theresia, daughter and successor of Karl VI, and Frederick the Great of Prussia led to Prussian rule over the Silesian territories. There were no further interest payments ; the investors lost everything they had lent. The founder of the important house of Deutz, Willem Gideon Deutz, has signed this bond in person.

Certificate of 3000 Founders' Shares. A very important company in the histories of Connecticut and Ohio, founder of the city of Cleveland and once owner of much of the State of Ohio. A grant from the English King Charles II in 1662 had given to Connecticut the title to all the territory between 41 and 42.2 degrees North in a band across the whole of America to the Pacific, some of this conflicting with rights also given to Pennsylvania. In 1763 the British government designated all lands east of the Appalachians and west of the Mississippi to be an Indian Reserve, so blocking the western expansion of all the colonies, and this was one of the grievances leading to the War of Independence. By the Treaty of Paris that ended the hostilities in 1783, Britain ceded the Indian Reserve to the United States. In the subsequent negotiations amongst the states, Connecticut ceded to Pennsylvania in the east and to the federal government in the west most of its 41st Parallel claim, retaining an area 120 miles wide to the west of Pennsylvania, later called the Connecticut Western Reserve (separated by several hundred miles from Connecticut). In 1795 a group of investors paid the State $1,200,000 for the Western Reserve and formed themselves into the Connecticut Land Company with 1,200,000 shares. The largest shareholder was Oliver Phelps, a major speculator in western New York lands also, who subscribed for 168,000 shares in his sole name and another 80,000 jointly with a partner. In 1796 the company began the development of what was to become the State of Ohio. They sent Moses Cleaveland to survey the Reserve and lay out townships, amongst others the foundations of the city of Cleveland, and set about selling land to settlers from the East. In 1800 Connecticut ceded sovereignty over the Western Reserve and it was absorbed into the Northwest Territory, then in 1803 became the north-east part of the State of Ohio.

Text partly written (hard to read) but mainly printed (easily legible). The colony government, sitting at Newport, raised, through the 6th landbank, a 5% loan of \u00c2\u00a3100.000 in 1738, being the 12th year of the reign of King George II. Repayment was to follow 25 years later. The underlying mortgage had to be double the face value of the bond. The bond was issued to Edward Arnold, a great grandson of William Arnold who was one of the 13 original colonists of Providence (Indian purchase). On behalf of the Colony, a panel of 6 strustees acted for the general assembly of that colony, called the Grand Committee. These men were John Wanton, George Goulding, Jahleel Brenton, Daniel Updike, John Gardner and Jahleel Brenton. Signed by Edward Arnold (with a tiny part of his wax seal remaining), Joseph Potter, John Warner, Ezekiel Warner and Richard Waterman. A 2008 Princeton University study about taxation in colonial America (by A. Rabushka) states that \"the interest paid by the borrowers was sufficient to pay the entire cost of the colony's government during the era of saultary neglect\". This is by far the oldest scripophily we have ever offered from what would later became the United States. Of great historic interest. This was a time when the various colonies in New England were issuing new loans in a paper currency which was steadily depreciating in value, to become almost worthless in time. The price of silver, as the only reliable store of value, rose regularly, in terms of the colonial currency.\u000bRhode island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large issues of paper money and their subsequent depreciation led Parliament in 1751 to enact a ban on the issue of all new paper money in the New England colonies (and subsequently, in 1764, in all the remaining colonies).\u000bRhode Island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first paper money, issued in 1710, was fiat currency backed by future taxes.8 Its subsequent issues were mainly loan-office disbursements for 10-year mortgage loans at 5 percent interest. Interest on the first loan was earmarked for the repair of Fort Ann. This loan was known as the First Bank.\u000bA subsequent issue in 1715, re-dated 1721, known as the Second Bank, was extended for five years, with interest payable in flax and hemp. These loans were later extended to 23 years in duration. The Third Bank, approved in 1728, issued \u00c2\u00a349,000 to replace all prior issues and provide funds for further repair of Fort Ann. The Fourth Bank (1734) issued \u00c2\u00a360,000 at 5 percent interest as 10-year delayed mortgage loans. The Fifth Bank (1733) issued \u00c2\u00a3104,000, with interest earmarked for cannon at Fort George. The Sixth Bank (1738) issued \u00c2\u00a3100,000 for 20-year mortgages at 5 percent interest. The Seventh Bank (1740) issued \u00c2\u00a324,000 on 20 years at 4 percent. The Eighth Bank (1743) issued \u00c2\u00a340,000 on similar terms.\u000bDue to these large issues, in contrast with the middle colonies, Rhode Island notes did not maintain their value. Depreciation of Rhode Island currency resulted in the creation of notes designated New Tenor, each of which was worth four times the previous issues, the Old Tenor notes. The Ninth Bank (1750) issued \u00c2\u00a350,000 New Tenor notes in five-year mortgages at 6 percent interest; a year later the loans were doubled in duration and the interest reduced to 5 percent.\u000bRhode Island loan offices did not directly re-lend repaid bills. Rather, each time the currency in circulation declined due to repayment, a new bank was authorized and its issue of bills increased the total supply of money in circulation compared with authorization of the prior bank. The nominal value of Rhode Island paper money for each 1,000 persons peaked at \u00c2\u00a331,500 Rhode Island currency in 1760, but its real exchange rate value amounted to \u00c2\u00a359 English sterling.

The base of the building is decorated with the flattened, abstract ornament characteristic of the Art Deco period. All of the ornament was custom-designed for the building including a floral bas relief in terra-cotta by Edward Trumbull.\u000b\u000bIn contrast to its neighbor, Grand Central Terminal, the Chanin Building's Art Deco facade represents a turn away from the Beaux Arts style towards a more humanistic and modern imagery appropriate to the industrial age. In particular, the facade illustrates the introduction of colored glass, stone and metal on the exterior of tall buildings. Materials such as bronze, Belgian marble and terra-cotta are used here in an inventive and exuberant way. Inside the lobby, the walls are decorated with reliefs by set-designer Jacques Delamarre and Renee Chambellan that represent \"The City of Opportunity\" and \"The Active Life of the Individual,\" the latter perhaps a reference to Chanin's own rise to power and wealth.\u000b\u000bAbove the base, the building's steel frame is clad in buff brick and terra cotta and it is set back in conformance with the 1916 Zoning Law. At the top, it is capped by a dramatic crown that was once illuminated at night. To attract tenants, Chanin provided centralized services at the base of the building including an underground connection to Grand Central Terminal and ground-floor commercial spaces. A movie theater and a subterranean bus terminal were included in the original project but no longer remain. Chanin himself had his own offices on the 50th and 51st floors of the tower that were famous for a theater and an award-winning bathroom.","location":"United States","date":null,"period":"20th Century","type":"debt","gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11184,"title":"Times Square - 46th Street Building","description":"Times Square - 46th Street Building 1556 Broadway Corporation 1928 gold bond","location":"United States","date":null,"period":"20th Century","type":"debt","gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11187,"title":"170 Broadway Building","description":"170 Broadway Building (Corner of Broadway\/Maiden Lane) gold bond - New Yrok 1925","location":"United States","date":null,"period":"20th Century","type":"debt","gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11189,"title":"5% Bularian Government loan","description":"Government loan for 500 francs secured with tobacco wrappers.

The signatures of Lady Anna Elinora Shirley and Elizabeth Franklin (witness) appear at the bottom. \u000bThe ladies Shirley, both spinsters, were in all likelihood, sisters of the first Earl of Ferrers, Robert Shirley.\u000bThese ladies were probably one of the first female speculatiors. In 1720, Lady Anna (or she and her sister, Lady Elizabeth) is on record for a total of 29 transactions in seniot and engrafted share of the Royal African Company. According to financial historican Anne Carlos, Lady Anna Elinora Shirley enjoyed gains between \u00e2\u0082\u00a42,000 and \u00e2\u0082\u00a47,000 as a result of these activities.  Lady Barbara does not appear in these transfer books for the Royal African Company, however she was an active investor. \u000bThe curent document represents an exchange bewteen the sisters. Lady Anna Elinora had apparently purchased stock in the South Sea Company in the thrid subscription. It is  not suprising that Lady Anna Elinors transferred these shares by way of a signed note, since the company never issued receipts for the thrid and fourth subscriptions. The company undertook the thrid subscription on June 17, 1720, at the height of the bubble. In this subscription, it issued 50,000 shares at a market price of \u00e2\u0082\u00a41,000 per share. Subscribers paid \u00e2\u0082\u00a4100 upfront, and the remainder was scheduled to be paid in nine semi-annual payments over the subsequent 5 years. Therefore, it appears that Lady Anna Elinora initially purchased at lease 5 shares in the company. However, after the market crashed at the end of th esummer of 1720, the government made adjustments to the distribution of shares among the 4 rounds of subscribers \"so that losses to later subscribers were reduced.\" Thus, the number of shares in question in teh transfer between Lady Anna Elinora and Lady Barbara may be greater than 5. The exact terms of the exchange between teh sisters is unclear. It is possible that Lady Anna Elinora sold the stock to her sister.  Assuming that the South Sea Company never collected any of teh semi-annual payments on the subscriptions after the bubble burst, she likely sold at a gain. On April 21, the market price of a share, according to Larry Neal's dataset was \u00e2\u0082\u00a4143. At this price, Lady Anna Elinora made at least 43% return, not accounting for inflation.","location":"Netherlands","date":null,"period":"18th Century or before","type":null,"gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11509,"title":"Leverpool Plantation loan 1809","description":"Loan to rename Leverpool Plantation to Cornelis Friendship Plantation in the Colony Suriname (Dutch Guiana) in 1801.","location":"Netherlands\u001dSuriname","date":null,"period":"19th Century","type":null,"gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11513,"title":"Annasburg Plantation Loan 1820","description":"Annaburg Plantation Loan","location":"Netherlands\u001dSuriname","date":null,"period":"18th Century or before","type":null,"gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11516,"title":"Broedersgift Plantation loan 1802","description":"Broedersgift Plantation loan 1802","location":"Suriname\u001dNetherlands","date":null,"period":"19th Century","type":null,"gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11520,"title":"Plantation Brouwerslust and Killenstein loans 1793","description":"Plantation Brouwerslust and Killenstein loans 1793","location":"Suriname\u001dNetherlands","date":null,"period":"19th Century","type":null,"gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11526,"title":"Breedvoort en De Herstelling Plantation loan 1794","description":"Breedvoort en De Herstelling Plantation loan 1794","location":"Suriname\u001dNetherlands","date":null,"period":"18th Century or before","type":null,"gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11555,"title":"Plantation loan along Essequebo and Demmerary Rivers","description":"","location":"Suriname\u001dNetherlands","date":null,"period":"19th Century","type":null,"gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11559,"title":"THEODORE PASSALAIGUE Plantation loan","description":"Plantation loan signed January 1778.","location":"Suriname\u001dNetherlands","date":null,"period":"18th Century or before","type":null,"gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""},{"id":11561,"title":"Plantation,  THEODORE PASSALAIGUE","description":"","location":null,"date":null,"period":null,"type":null,"gallery":[],"ledger":"","owner":""}]
